# Newton polynomial
### In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, a Newton polynomial, named after its inventor Isaac Newton,[1] is an interpolation polynomial for a given set of 
### data points. The Newton polynomial is sometimes called Newton's divided differences interpolation polynomial because the coefficients of the polynomial are 
### calculated using Newton's divided differences method. 
### Newton's formula is of interest because it is the straightforward and natural differences-version of Taylor's polynomial. Taylor's polynomial tells where a function ### will go, based on its y value, and its derivatives (its rate of change, and the rate of change of its rate of change, etc.) at one particular x value. Newton's 
### formula is Taylor's polynomial based on finite differences instead of instantaneous rates of change.
